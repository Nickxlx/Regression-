    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression model that includes a regularization term in the cost function. It is used to handle multicollinearity, overfitting and reduce the impact of irrelevant features in a regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression differs from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression in that it adds a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term, controlled by a regularization parameter (Î» or alpha), shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing their magnitudes. This regularization helps to mitigate the impact of multicollinearity and overfitting, making Ridge Regression more robust and less prone to high-variance estimates. Unlike OLS regression, Ridge Regression does not eliminate any predictors but instead decreases their influence, providing a more balanced model."

    "Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> Ridge Regression, as a regularization technique, does not perform feature selection in the same way as methods like Lasso Regression. Ridge Regression retains all predictors in the model and reduces their impact through shrinkage, but it does not set coefficients exactly to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Ridge Regression can still indirectly assist in feature selection by assigning lower weights or shrinking the coefficients of less relevant predictors towards zero. As lambda (the tuning parameter) increases in Ridge Regression, the impact of the predictors on the model decreases, and less important predictors may have coefficients close to zero. This can be interpreted as a form of feature prioritization, where predictors with smaller coefficients are considered less influential in the model."

    "Answer--> \n",
    "Ridge Regression performs well in the presence of multicollinearity, which is a situation where the predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can cause instability and inflated variances of the estimated coefficients in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. However, Ridge Regression addresses this issue by adding a penalty termmterm to the cost function, which shrinks the coefficients towards zero. By shrinking the coefficients, Ridge Regression reduces the impact of highly correlated predictors and mitigates the instability caused by multicollinearity"

    "\n",
    "For continuous variables, no additional preprocessing is required, and Ridge Regression can directly incorporate them into the model. The coefficients assigned to continuous variables represent the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable.\n",

    "However, handling categorical variables in Ridge Regression requires encoding them into numerical form since Ridge Regression is a numerical optimization technique. There are various ways to encode categorical variables. Once categorical variables are encoded, they can be treated as regular continuous variables in the Ridge Regression model. The coefficients associated with the encoded variables represent the difference in the dependent variable between the reference category and the specific category."
