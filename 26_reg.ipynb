    "Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> Linear regression relies on several assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of the results. Let's discuss the key assumptions of linear regression and methods to check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear. You can check this assumption by creating scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable and looking for a roughly linear pattern. If the relationship appears to be nonlinear, you may need to consider transforming the variables or using nonlinear regression techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence: The observations in the dataset should be independent of each other. This assumption assumes that there is no correlation or dependence between the residuals or errors of the model. You can check for independence by examining the residuals for any patterns or correlations using techniques like autocorrelation plots or the Durbin-Watson test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity assumes that the variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be consistent throughout the range of the predictor variables. You can check for homoscedasticity by plotting the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variables. If the spread of the residuals appears to change systematically with the predicted values or independent variables, it indicates heteroscedasticity, and you may need to consider data transformations or alternative regression techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality: The residuals or errors should be normally distributed. This assumption is crucial for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals. You can check for normality by creating a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and visually assessing if they follow a roughly normal distribution. Additionally, you can use statistical tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Anderson-Darling test for normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No multicollinearity: The predictor variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. You can check for multicollinearity by calculating the correlation matrix among the predictor variables and examining the correlation coefficients. Values close to -1 or 1 indicate high correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visualize the data: Plot the independent variables against the dependent variable and examine the scatter plots for linearity. Additionally, plot the residuals against the predicted values or independent variables to assess homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Residual analysis: Calculate the residuals (observed values minus predicted values) and analyze them for patterns or correlations to assess independence. Look for any systematic patterns or autocorrelation in the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Normality test: Create a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and visually assess if they follow a roughly normal distribution. You can also use statistical tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Anderson-Darling test for normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Correlation analysis: Calculate the correlation matrix among the predictor variables to check for multicollinearity. Look for high correlation coefficients (close to -1 or 1) between the predictors.\n"

    "Q3. How do you interpret the slope and intercept in a linear regression model? Provide an example using a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept are key components that help interpret the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slop indicates the rate of change in the dependent variable associated with a unit change in the independent variable. A positive slope indicates a positive relationship between the variables, while a negative slope indicates a negative relationship.\n",

    "\n",
    "Electricity Consumption = 100 + 5 * Average Monthly Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intercept (100): When the average monthly temperature is zero, the predicted monthly electricity consumption is 100 units. This intercept value represents the baseline consumption that is not influenced by temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slope (5): For each one-unit increase in the average monthly temperature, the predicted monthly electricity consumption increases by 5 units, assuming all other factors remain constant. This positive slope indicates that as the temperature rises, households tend to consume more electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the average monthly temperature increases by 1 degree Celsius, we would expect the monthly electricity consumption to increase by 5 units.\n"

    "Q8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of polynomial regression compared to linear regression? In what situations would you prefer to use polynomial regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer-->  Advantages of Polynomial Regression compared to Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Capturing Nonlinear Relationships: Polynomial regression can capture nonlinear relationships between variables. It allows for more flexible modeling of complex patterns in the data that cannot be adequately represented by a linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increased Model Fit: By introducing polynomial terms, the model can better fit the data points and provide a more accurate representation of the underlying relationship between the variables. It can capture U-shaped or inverted U-shaped patterns, interactions, and other nonlinear variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression compared to Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overfitting Risk: As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model becomes more complex and has a higher risk of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model fits the training data extremely well but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. Regularization techniques such as Ridge regression or cross-validation can help mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Interpretability: The interpretation of coefficients becomes more complex in polynomial regression. It becomes challenging to directly attribute the effect of a specific independent variable, as the impact of an independent variable can vary with different polynomial terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Situations to Prefer Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nonlinear Relationships: When there is a clear indication or prior knowledge that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is nonlinear, polynomial regression is preferred. It allows for a more accurate representation of the underlying relationship and can capture intricate patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Curvature and Bends: Polynomial regression is suitable when there are curvature or bends in the relationship between the variables. Linear regression cannot capture such nonlinear variations, and polynomial terms enable the model to fit the data more appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interaction Effects: Polynomial regression can also be useful in capturing interaction effects between variables. By including interaction terms (product terms of independent variables), it can model the joint effect of variables and capture interactions that linear regression cannot.\n"
